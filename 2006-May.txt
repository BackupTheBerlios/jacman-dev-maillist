Subject: [Jacman-dev] [Patch] Properly use --ignore during update
Message-ID: <200605251431.35812.askadar@cs.tu-berlin.de>

Hi Jacman Devs,

first of all let me thank you for the great pacman front-end! Unfortunately, I 
think I stumbled over a bug. Selecting packages to ignore during an upgrade 
does not work for me, please have a look at a screen shot for details [1].

The attached patch fixes the problem for me.

Best regards,
Bj?rn

Bjorn,

Thanks for identifying the bug (I haven't verified it yet, but I trust 
you!). I will add the patch if that really does solve it. I can't 
actually see why it makes a difference. But, I'm tired as I've just come 
back from a conference in Italy and haven't had enough sleep yet!

Cheers,
Andy

PS If you fancy becoming a contributor (with as much/little as you like) 
then let me know and I'll give you access to the CVS repo.

Well I think it makes a difference because the old version is equivalent to
	pacman -Su '--ignore <pkg>'
(note the ticks) while the patched version is equivalent to
	pacman -Su --ingore <pkg>
which is what we actually want.

Thank you for the cvs offer, but unfortunately I don't have the time right now to contribute on a regular basis. I'll get back to it if I happen have more patches ready.

Best regards,
Bjoern
